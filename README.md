# RegEx-Calculator
A calculator that leverages Regular Expressions to validate and process mathematical expressions. Initially envisioned as a variant of a Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) calculator, it evolved into a regex-based solution for learning and experimentation. This approach ensures structured input handling while enhancing pattern recognition in mathematical computations.
